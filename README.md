# Project Description

This project is an inventory of my current understanding of Java.
It is split into 4 categories as follows:

### Algorithms
This part includes various types of algorithms such as Backtracking, Searching and Sorting.

**Note: This is not an exhaustive list of algorithms and I will add some as I learn them**

### DataStructures
This is the part where I'm adding complex DS such as LinkedList or Trees.

### Design Patterns
As a software engineer, design patterns are an important part of coding clean, robust and flexible code. 
Therefore, this part includes most of the main design patterns developed by the GoF.

### JavaBasics
This part is all about the various APIs provided by Java, such as serialization and networking as well as
some basic OO principles in action like polymorphism.

## What's next?
As stated at the beginning, this is just an inventory of my current knowledge about Java.
Thus, this project will keep growing as I learn.
The next steps of my learning progress are: 

### Graphs
This will be included both in `DataStructures` about how and why to use graph, 
as well as in `Algorithms` (Dijkstra's algorithm for example).

### StreamAPI
As a way to improve my coding skills, functional programming will be needed.

The Java Stream API is all about it and I aim at learning more of it soon and will
be included in the `JavaBasics` section.

### Dynamic Programming
This will go hand to hand with recursion, as it's a concept on how to simplify recursions.
Both of them will be included within the `Algorithms` section.
